## Bacteria Simulator

This is a group project developed for a Java OOP class. We wanted to simulate the growth of a simple bacteria population.

The team proposes to carry out a bacterial simulation in which different species can be defined and compared in an environment where they will have to move in search of food that  will appear over time; feed to survive and reproduce by binary splitting, division of the organism into two exact copies. Furthermore, random mutations of the organisms will be foreseen. Finally, the simulation involves an analysis of the evolution of the species in order to evaluate the adaptation of the organisms.
