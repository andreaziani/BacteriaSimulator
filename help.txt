Welcome to Bacteria Simulator!

Before starting:
- create at least one new species of bacteria by pressing the "Create Species" button.
- create at least one new type of food by pressing the "Create food" button.
- set the distribution strategy for foods.

Creation of species:
during the creation of the species you will have to choose between different behaviors that the species can assume, set the name of the species and choose the color.

Creation of food:
during the creation of food you will have to set the name of the type of food, add the nutrients of the food by setting their quantity and choose the color.

Set Strategy:
Set the strategy by choosing it from the multiple choice box and then press the button "Set Strategy" to confirm.
if you do not choose anything the strategy will be a uniform distribution.

Once you have created at least one species and a food, you can start the simulation by pressing the "Start" button.
During the simulation you can add food manually by choosing it from the list of existing foods and clicking on the simulation area where you want to add food. 
Food will also be added following the chosen strategy at each turn, furthermore during the simulation dead bacteria will transform in food, this types of food has a black color.

After the simulation you can view the analysis of the species and understand the behavior of the species in the environment.
